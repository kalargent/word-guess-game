# word-guess-game

As part of this project, I was taked with writing a Word Guess Game. 

I used the following technologies as part of this: 

- HTML/CSS 
- Javascript
- Bootstrap 

I completed this project after a short three weeks into my bootcamp experience. 

Some requirement highlights: 

- Win/Loss Counts 
- Randomly selects a word from the array and displays it as blank spaces 
- Bases the number of tries dynamically, based on the randomly selected word
- Alerts the user when they win/lose 
- Tracks already used letters 
- Uses basic bootstrap components
